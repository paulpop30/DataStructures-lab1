L1:Dynamic Array

Implement in C++ the given container (ADT) using a given representation and a dynamic array as a data structure. You are not allowed to use the vector from STL or from any other library. 
Obs:
- You are not allowed to use the functions memcpy and realloc, because it is not safe to use memcpy and realloc on memory that was allocated with new. Also, if the memory location contains objects, undefined behavior can occur. The implementation might still work with these functions, but it is not a good practice to use them.
- If you think that you need helper functions, feel free to add them(but as private functions, so as to avoid violating the principle of abstraction)

ADT Bag â€“ represented using a dynamic array of <element, frequency> pairs (or two dynamic arrays). For example, the bag [5, 10, -1, 2, 3, 10, 5, 5, -5] will be represented as [(5,3), (10, 2), (-1, 1),(2, 1), (3, 1),(-5, 1)].
